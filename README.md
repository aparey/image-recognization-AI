# Image Recognition AI

This project focuses on developing an image recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system is trained on a labeled dataset of images and is capable of classifying new images into predefined categories. It leverages deep learning algorithms and popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and accurate image recognition system. By utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system learns to identify patterns and features within images, enabling it to categorize them appropriately. This approach is inspired by the human visual system and has been proven effective in various computer vision tasks.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies input images into predefined categories based on learned patterns.
- **Model Training**: Includes scripts and notebooks for training the model on custom datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides tools to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aparey/image-recognization-AI.git
   cd image-recognization-AI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Organize your images into subdirectories within a main directory, where each subdirectory name corresponds to a category label.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Adjust the training parameters as needed in the training script or notebook.
   - Run the training process:
     ```bash
     python train.py
     ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Use the evaluation script to assess the model's performance on a validation dataset:
     ```bash
     python evaluate.py
     ```

4. **Classify New Images**:
   - Utilize the prediction script to classify new images:
     ```bash
     python predict.py --image_path path_to_image
     ```
